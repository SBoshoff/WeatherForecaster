## Introduction

This is my submission for the Etain technical test.

## Running the app

* Open a shell in ClientApp and run `npm install`
* Run IISExpress in Visual Studio

## Currently missing features

* Pull-to-refresh. There is a refresh functionality present, but it exists as a button. Not many reliable libraries exist for pull-to-refresh.
